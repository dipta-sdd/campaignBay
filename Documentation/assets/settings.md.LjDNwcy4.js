When this toggle is <strong>ON</strong>, the plugin is active and will apply discounts to your store. When it is <strong>OFF</strong>, the entire pricing engine is disabled, and no discounts will be calculated or applied. This is a safe way to temporarily disable all campaigns at once without deactivating the plugin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Default Rule Priority:</strong> This sets a default priority number for new campaigns. This is used by the discount engine to resolve conflicts when multiple campaigns could apply to the same product. A <strong>lower number means a higher priority</strong>. For example, a rule with priority <code>10</code> will be applied before a rule with priority <code>20</code>.

It activates the plugin&#39;s caching system, which stores the list of active campaigns in a temporary cache (a WordPress transient). This dramatically improves performance by preventing the plugin from querying the database on every single page load.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clear Discount Cache:</strong> If you ever make a change to a campaign and do not see it reflected on the frontend immediately, you can click this button to manually clear the campaign cache.
