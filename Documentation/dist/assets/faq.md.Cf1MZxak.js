On your storefront, it uses a multi-level caching system to store active campaign rules. This means it only needs to query the database periodically, not on every page load, ensuring a fast experience for your customers. You can manage the cache from the <strong>Settings → Global Settings</strong> tab.</p><h3 id="is-the-plugin-compatible-with-my-theme" tabindex="-1">Is the plugin compatible with my theme? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-the-plugin-compatible-with-my-theme" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is the plugin compatible with my theme?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes. CampaignBay is designed to be compatible with all modern WordPress themes that follow WooCommerce standards. It fully supports both <strong>Classic Themes</strong> (like Storefront) and modern <strong>Block Themes</strong> (like Twenty Twenty-Four). We use the recommended hooks and systems to ensure that discount calculations and displays work correctly across both environments.</p><hr><h2 id="discount-campaign-logic" tabindex="-1">Discount &amp; Campaign Logic <a class="header-anchor" href="#discount-campaign-logic" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Discount &amp; Campaign Logic&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="my-discount-isn-t-applying-what-should-i-check-first" tabindex="-1">My discount isn&#39;t applying.

What should I check first?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is the most common issue and is usually due to a simple configuration setting. Please run through this checklist:</p><ol><li><strong>Is the Campaign <code>Active</code>?</strong> Go to <strong>CampaignBay → All Campaigns</strong> and ensure the campaign&#39;s status is <code>Active</code> or <code>Scheduled</code>, not <code>Inactive</code> or <code>Expired</code>.</li><li><strong>Is the Schedule Correct?</strong> If the campaign is <code>Scheduled</code>, make sure the current date and time are within the Start and End dates you have set.</li><li><strong>Is the Product Targeted Correctly?</strong> Double-check the &quot;Discount Target&quot; settings in your campaign. If it&#39;s targeted to a specific product or category, ensure the product you are testing is included in that target group.</li><li><strong>Is &quot;Exclude Sale Items&quot; Enabled?</strong> This is a campaign-level setting. Edit your campaign and check under &quot;Other Configurations&quot; to see if the &quot;Exclude Sale Items&quot; box is checked. If it is, your campaign discount will not apply to any product that already has a native WooCommerce sale price.</li><li><strong>Is Caching Delaying the Update?</strong> If you just created the campaign, there might be a small delay due to caching. Go to <strong>Settings → Global Settings</strong> and click the <strong>&quot;Clear Discount Cache&quot;</strong> button.</li></ol><h3 id="why-is-only-one-of-my-campaigns-applying-when-a-product-qualifies-for-two" tabindex="-1">Why is only one of my campaigns applying when a product qualifies for two? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-only-one-of-my-campaigns-applying-when-a-product-qualifies-for-two" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why is only one of my campaigns applying when a product qualifies for two?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is the intended behavior by default. To prevent unexpected &quot;double discounts,&quot; the engine first finds the single best <strong>Product-Level</strong> discount (<code>Scheduled</code> or <code>Early Bird</code>). This logic is controlled by the &quot;Handle Multiple Product Discounts&quot; setting.</p><p>If stacking is disabled, this winning discount then competes with any applicable <strong>Cart-Level</strong> discounts, and only the single best overall discount is applied.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Learn More About This Logic</p><p>We have a dedicated guide that explains how the discount engine prioritizes and stacks different campaigns.</p><p><strong><a href="./core-concepts/understanding-the-engine.html">Read the Full Guide: The Discount Engine &amp; Stacking →</a></strong></p></div><h3 id="can-customers-use-a-woocommerce-coupon-with-a-campaignbay-discount" tabindex="-1">Can customers use a WooCommerce coupon with a CampaignBay discount? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-customers-use-a-woocommerce-coupon-with-a-campaignbay-discount" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can customers use a WooCommerce coupon with a CampaignBay discount?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is controlled by a global setting. Navigate to <strong>Settings → Cart Settings</strong> and toggle the <strong>&quot;Allow Stacking with WooCommerce Coupons&quot;</strong> option.</p><ul><li><strong>If OFF (Default):</strong> The systems are mutually exclusive. If a CampaignBay discount is active, coupons cannot be applied, and vice-versa.</li><li><strong>If ON:</strong> A customer can use a coupon code on top of a price that has already been discounted by CampaignBay.</li></ul><h3 id="for-quantity-discounts-is-a-fixed-discount-5-off-applied-once-or-to-every-item" tabindex="-1">For Quantity Discounts, is a fixed discount ($5 off) applied once or to every item? <a class="header-anchor" href="#for-quantity-discounts-is-a-fixed-discount-5-off-applied-once-or-to-every-item" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;For Quantity Discounts, is a fixed discount ($5 off) applied once or to every item?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It is applied to <strong>every single item</strong> that qualifies for the tier.

This is the fairest method and prevents a single large purchase from using up all the available Early Bird slots.</p><h3 id="what-happens-to-the-early-bird-count-if-an-order-is-cancelled" tabindex="-1">What happens to the Early Bird count if an order is cancelled? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happens-to-the-early-bird-count-if-an-order-is-cancelled" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What happens to the Early Bird count if an order is cancelled?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If an order that used an Early Bird slot is later cancelled, refunded, or fails, that &quot;slot&quot; is automatically <strong>released and becomes available again</strong>. The usage counter is decremented, ensuring the next customer can claim the offer.</p><hr><h2 id="frontend-display" tabindex="-1">Frontend Display <a class="header-anchor" href="#frontend-display" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Frontend Display&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="can-i-customize-the-messages-shown-to-the-customer" tabindex="-1">Can I customize the messages shown to the customer? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-customize-the-messages-shown-to-the-customer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can I customize the messages shown to the customer?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes.

To fix this, simply navigate to <strong>Settings → Global Settings</strong> and click the <strong>&quot;Clear Discount Cache&quot;</strong> button.
