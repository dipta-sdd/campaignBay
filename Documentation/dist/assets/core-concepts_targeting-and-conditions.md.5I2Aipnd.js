When selected, the campaign&#39;s discount will be applied to <strong>every single product</strong> in your WooCommerce store (unless excluded by other campaign rules like &quot;Exclude Sale Items&quot;).</li><li><strong>Best for:</strong> Store-wide sales events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, anniversary sales, or any promotion where you want to offer a discount on everything.</li><li><strong>Configuration:</strong> No further configuration is needed.
