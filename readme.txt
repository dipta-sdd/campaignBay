### **Key Features in Detail**

*   **Powerful Campaign Types:**
    *   **Scheduled Discount:** The classic sales campaign. Set a percentage or fixed amount discount that automatically starts and stops on the dates and times you define. Perfect for any time-based promotion.
    *   **Quantity Based Discount:** Create unlimited pricing tiers to reward customers for buying more. Offer a 10% discount for buying 5+, a 20% discount for buying 10+, and so on. The discount is applied per-item and is perfect for bulk or wholesale pricing.
    *   **Early Bird Discount:** A powerful marketing tool to drive urgency. Offer a special discount to the "first X customers." The plugin automatically tracks successful orders and moves customers to the next discount tier once a limit is reached.

*   **Advanced Targeting & Conditions:**
    *   **Granular Control:** Don't just discount everything. Target your campaigns to the **Entire Store**, specific **Product Categories**, or individual **Products**.
    *   **Intelligent Exclusions:** A global setting allows you to automatically prevent your campaigns from applying to products that are already on a native WooCommerce sale, preventing "double-discounting" and protecting your margins.

*   **Full Scheduling & Automation:**
    *   **"Set It and Forget It":** Configure your campaigns weeks or months in advance. Set the exact start and end date and time, and CampaignBay will handle the rest.
    *   **Timezone Aware:** All schedules are based on your WordPress site's configured timezone, so your sales start at 9 AM your time, not server time.
    *   **Reliable WP-Cron System:** Uses a robust scheduling system with a built-in failsafe to ensure your campaigns activate and expire on time, even on low-traffic sites.

*   **Smart Cart & Pricing Logic:**
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** When multiple campaigns apply to one product, the engine intelligently applies only the best discount for the customer, based on your settings.
    *   **Full Stacking Control:** You have complete authority over how discounts are combined.
        *   Enable/disable stacking with native WooCommerce coupons.
        *   Enable/disable stacking between different CampaignBay campaign types.

*   **Actionable Dashboard & Analytics:**
    *   **Data-Rich Overview:** Your central dashboard provides a beautiful and clear overview of your campaign performance with KPI cards and charts.
    *   **Track What Matters:** Instantly see your total discounted amount, the number of discounted orders, and the total sales generated by your campaigns over any time period.
    *   **Strategic Insights:** Discover your "Top Performing Campaigns" and "Top Performing Types" to understand which strategies are most effective for your store.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My scheduled campaign didn't start at the exact time. Why? =
CampaignBay uses the standard WordPress Cron system. On low-traffic sites, this can sometimes be delayed until the first person visits your site after the scheduled time. Our plugin includes a built-in failsafe that corrects the status, but for mission-critical sales, we recommend setting up a server cron job for 100% reliability.

= For Quantity Discounts, is a fixed discount ($5 off) applied once or to every item? =
It is applied to **every single item** that qualifies. If the rule is "Buy 3+, get $5 off" and a customer buys 4 items, they will receive a total discount of $20 ($5 x 4).

= Where can I find the full documentation? =
You can find the complete, detailed user guide by navigating to `Campaigns > Help` in your WordPress dashboard.
